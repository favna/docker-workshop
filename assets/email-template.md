Good afternoon all,
 
We kindly request that you install Docker with the WSL2 backend in preparation for our upcoming Docker course scheduled for upcoming Thursday on October 3rd.
You can find detailed install instructions at this link: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/
 
This requirement applies to all participants, including those from the Space unit.
 
We expect you all in Room 5 on the ground floor at 9:00.
Our expectation is that we end around 15:00.
 
Should you have any further questions or encounter difficulties during the installation process, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to either Jeroen Claassens, Gerard Mulder, or Brendan van Walstijn.
